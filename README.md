## What is this book about?
Swift has quickly become one of the most-liked languages and developers’ de-facto choice when building applications that target iOS and macOS. In the new version, the Swift team wants to take its adoption to the next level by making it available for new platforms and audiences.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Develop complex RESTful APIs from scratch with Python combined with and without data sources
* Choose the most appropriate (micro) framework based on the specific requirements of a RESTful API / web service
* Debug, test, and profile RESTful APIs with each of the frameworks
* Develop a complex RESTful API that interacts with a PostgreSQL database
* Add authentication and permissions to a RESTful API built in each of the frameworks
* Map URL patterns to request handlers and check how the API works
* Profile an existing API and refactor it to take advantage of asynchronous code
